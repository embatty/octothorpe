1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 John: I keep clicking the "Stop Video" button when I click back to Zoom.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,160
 Liz: What?

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,120
 Don't turn your video off.

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,400
 It's like you've gone off in a huff, John.

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,040
 John: I can't believe you said that Liz.

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,520
 Alison: Okay, that was a bit of a visual joke.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:29,320
 John: Hello, everyone.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,420
 And welcome to the very 83rd episode of Octothorpe, a podcast for science fiction and

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:40,280
 science fiction fandom, which is coming to you on the 11th of May 2023.

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,040
 And King Charles has got his crown on.

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,680
 I'm John Coxon.

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,200
 Alison: I'm Alison Scott.

13
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,480
 Liz: And I'm Liz Batty.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,200
 John: Did you guys enjoy the coronation?

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
 Liz: Probably.

16
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,440
 Alison: We're recording this one.

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,800
 Immediately after we recorded episode 82 because we have a load of stuff to talk about

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,160
 about Eastercon and so on.

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,520
 But we couldn't do any of that because we were too busy talking about the Hugo nominations

20
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,040
 in time for you to nominate.

21
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,840
 So John: I spent the coronation playing board games.

22
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,600
 Right then we have letters of comment.

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,760
 We don't have letters of comment on last episode because of what Alison just said, but we do

24
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,800
 have letters of comment on the two episodes from before that.

25
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,800
 So strap in.

26
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,480
 First up, we have a letter of comment from Raj who says that he strongly agrees with me

27
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,000
 that Digger is excellent and did point out that I hadn't put the link in the show notes

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,440
 but I have fixed that now.

29
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,400
 He has a hard copy, which is the omnibus that Sofa Wolf Press did years back and it is

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,400
 a beast of a book.

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,200
 And I have not got a hard copy, but I can imagine that it's quite big.

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,200
 Liz: Can you?

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,200
 Yes.

34
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,200
 John: Liz.

35
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:54,400
 Liz: Um, maybe to say, uh, thank you to everyone who watched us live at Eastercon and left

36
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:59,840
 a comment, and to those who watched us live and then listened to the actual podcast, which

37
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,440
 I think is going above and beyond.

38
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:07,840
 Thank you to Fran who left us a letter of comment.

39
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,640
 And I think this might be a new one.

40
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:17,240
 She left us a letter of comment in the Discord thread for our item on the Eastercon Discord.

41
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:20,480
 And she's basically off to give her cat some Dreamies via the medium of interpretive dance,

42
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
 which is another way of giving us a letter of comment.

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,280
 I would also like to say thank you to everyone who made our item at Conversation the one

44
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,720
 with the most Discord comments.

45
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:38,800
 I don't think this is a reflection of the engagement with the item so much as a "our listeners

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,480
 like to back channel a bunch of shit" at us in the Discord and also that we did start

47
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
 about half an hour late.

48
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,440
 So they had to really entertain themselves.

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,360
 John: Johnny Badeley also watched live and then listened to the podcast afterwards.

50
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,240
 So yeah, that is dedication.

51
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,440
 Liz: I mean, I didn't do that.

52
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:02,200
 Alison: There was some serious discussion about looking at the amount of engagement on the Discord

53
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,320
 as a measure of how good programme items were and guys don't do that.

54
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,800
 Joohn: Our programme item was the best programme item.

55
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,600
 Alison: We have the most comments on the Discord of any item at Conversation by a factor of

56
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,600
 about three, I think.

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,520
 The other thing about the live thing is at the end of it, it just kind of finished and

58
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,840
 then they turned off my Zoom and I was like, oh, that means I don't get to say goodbye

59
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,200
 to John and Liz! And Liz is going back to Thailand, because immediately now I am going

60
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,120
 to get in a car, get in a plague-ridden car and drive back to London.

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,320
 But neither of the other two people in the car got the plague.

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,320
 So there you go.

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,520
 But I didn't get to say goodbye.

64
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,160
 So bye bye, chaps.

65
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,640
 John: Bye Alison.

66
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,400
 We also heard from EspaÃ±a Sheriff who let us know that there is a D&D TV series in the

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,640
 works in which Joe Mangianello is adapting the Dragonlance series to TV, which we now

68
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,640
 know was a formative book series for both Niall Harrison and Adrian Tchaikovsy.

69
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,040
 So, yeah, interesting stuff.

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,560
 He's also working on a documentary.

71
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,880
 He is a massive nerd.

72
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:09,880
 It's good.

73
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
 I like it.

74
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,640
 Alison: Farah Mendlesohn wrote to say that we can't hold the Eastercon in Wales because we can't

75
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:22,600
 find a suitable venue, which I think is something that most people agree.

76
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:28,480
 And she also says that Telford is the main convention venue for Wales.

77
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,920
 Welsh people write in.

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,280
 John: I remember the Chester Eastercon.

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,720
 I wish we could go back to Chester.

80
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,320
 That was a great venue.

81
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,960
 Alison: Chester is also not a primary convention venue for Wales.

82
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,680
 John: It's better than Telford.

83
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,200
 Liz: But in terms of being in Wales.

84
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,840
 John: If there is a spectrum of Welshness, Chester is more Welsh than Telford.

85
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,840
 Liz: Yeah.

86
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,800
 John: I suspect that's just angered Welsh people and Chester people.

87
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
 So that's good.

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,000
 So we have a letter of comment from James Shields about Plan Z.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,760
 And we mentioned this in episode 80.

90
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,160
 He confirms that it is a fork of Zambia.

91
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,880
 And he does note, "For a while, I've felt that naming your project after an African country

92
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,160
 might be culturally insensitive".

93
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,280
 That is a fair thing to point out that we did not cover at the end of episode 80.

94
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,600
 There is a GitHub for Plan Z and listener to the show

95
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:25,200
 Andrew January has created a GitHub issue to suggest changing the name away from Plan

96
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
 Z.

97
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,680
 And we will put a link to that issue in the show notes if you want to contribute.

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,120
 There are some other names being suggested and whatnot.

99
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,480
 If I had known there was a GitHub repo for Plan Z, I would have gone and raised an issue

100
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,760
 myself but I did not know.

101
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,960
 So thank you to Andrew for telling us.

102
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,360
 Alison: Yes, Z Graves has suggested the name Ariadne because it weaves a lot of threads together.

103
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,040
 And I super like that.

104
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,400
 Plus it supports our spider theme.

105
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,480
 More spiders in science fiction, please.

106
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,960
 John: On the subject of spiders in science fiction, Esther McCallum Stewart wrote in to tell us that

107
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,920
 there will be a Spiders track at Glasgow in 2024.

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,080
 There will also be one about armadillos and one devoted to Badger and collectively the

109
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,960
 Badger Armadillo and Spiders tracks will be called "All about that BAS" which is an incredibly

110
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,600
 tortured joke that I loved.

111
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,160
 Thank you very much Esther.

112
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,160
 Liz: Very good.

113
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,480
 John: Chris Garcia wrote to us on the 31st of March.

114
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,760
 And he says it was another good episode.

115
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,520
 And notes that there has been small scale octopus farming for centuries by his tribe.

116
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:32,320
 You'd find corals of thornwood, redwood and oak put in tiny bays that would keep

117
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
 them in pens.

118
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,840
 They used a lasso to catch them and dumped them in there.

119
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,740
 The Oak is sturdy, the Thornwood prickly and the Redwood full of tannins that octopus

120
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,920
 don't much care for.

121
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:44,240
 They also supposedly penned in dolphins but they don't get residuals from SeaWorld.

122
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,680
 That is a horrific thing to tell us.

123
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
 Thank you very much Chris.

124
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,560
 Alison: Yeah, there's a difference between kind of trapping some wild octopus behind plants they

125
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,240
 don't like and having a massive Chinese octopus farm, right?

126
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,400
 John: The Chinese octopus farm of course being in Spain.

127
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,080
 Famous for its Chinese farms, Spain.

128
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,440
 He also notes if the Third Row panel isn't held with all the participants sitting in

129
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,600
 the Rhird Row, then we all are leaving money on the table.

130
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,840
 As Andrew Hogg has said, many a time, the Third rRw isn't a place.

131
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,480
 If a third rower sits in a row, that row is the third row.

132
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,920
 And so it shall always be.

133
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:30,640
 Alison One of the best lines in the third row panel was Mark Plummer pointing out that in that

134
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:36,960
 same third row where third row fandom was formed, Peter Mabey was sitting who was 78

135
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
 at the time.

136
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,640
 John: we have known Peter Mabey was in third row fandom.

137
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:44,360
 He doesn't respond to our emails but he is more than welcome.

138
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:53,120
 Peter, if you're listening, there's a Discord.

139
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,200
 Chengdu is a shower segment.

140
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,920
 Sunny spells this week, not much showering is occurring.

141
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:05,440
 Liz: I would say I did have a chat to Francesco Verso at Eastercon who I think is helping

142
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:17,240
 out in some ways on programme for Chengdu and it all sounded pretty good actually.

143
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:23,440
 Alison: I was delighted that Sandra Bond, who was one of the candidates that I nominated, is

144
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,880
 going to be the TAFF delegate to Pemmicon in Winnipeg in August.

145
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:36,360
 So Pemmicon is the NASFIC and I think that Sandra will be an excellent delegate and I

146
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,040
 was very pleased to see her win.

147
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:45,320
 And I hope that MikoÅaj will run again because he had a lot of support in Europe and I think

148
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:52,120
 also could do with making more connections in the US to pick up North American votes there.

149
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:55,720
 Liz: Yeah, is it MikoÅaj's third loss?

150
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,720
 John: I think it's second.

151
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,520
 Liz: Second, sorry second.

152
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
 So I don't know.

153
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:07,400
 I feel so if anyone who runs twice and loses both times and I hope they will run again.

154
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,880
 John: I think there might be, oh I'm trying to think of a way of saying this, that is, well

155
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,160
 to lose once is sad.

156
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:22,280
 To lose twice might mean you need to change your North American nominators to people who

157
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,920
 will actually get your vote out.

158
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:33,280
 I am sure the people that MikoÅaj picked were great but I would maybe, I mean, Chris

159
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,160
 Garcia, he's very good at getting people to vote for people, like consider writing him an email.

160
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,480
 There are merits in choosing your nominators carefully in the territory you're less well

161
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,480
 known in.

162
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,480
 That wasn't very diplomatic but yes.

163
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:54,520
 Alison: For a race where the final date was the day after Eastercon, Sandra chose three European

164
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,800
 nominators who were all on the Eastercon committee.

165
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,840
 John: Yeah I willl also say Sandra's selection of nominators was, sorry Sandra, terrible because

166
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,800
 you're basically choosing three people who all appeal to the same- 

167
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,240
 Alison: Oh thanks a lot.

168
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,200
 John: I mean but you want to choose three people who will appeal to different demographics,

169
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,200
 not three people who are all in the same group of people.

170
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,720
 So yes, I think that's one area where MikoÅaj did better because he had a much wider range

171
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,920
 of European nominators.

172
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,560
 But Sandra won so, you know, hindsight is irrelevant.

173
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:33,840
 Alison: Sandra did pick at least one nominator who went round every single person at Corflu going,

174
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,360
 have you voted in TAFF yet?

175
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,880
 And not leaving until they either said yes or went and did it so that will have helped.

176
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:46,040
 Liz: But I mean when you say you should pick your North American nominators very carefully,

177
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:52,840
 I think it's possible that Sandra's nominators, John D. Berry and Ted White, also kind of appeal

178
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,520
 to a similar constituency, right?

179
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,080
 I mean maybe that is it.

180
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,280
 John: Oh yeah, but Sandra is incredibly well known in North America fandom.

181
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,280
 Liz: Okay.

182
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:05,600
 John: he point is you need to make sure, so like I did a blog post, this is getting slightly

183
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,160
 into the weeds, but I did a blog post after the 2013 race where I broke down how many

184
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,880
 of the votes for Jim Mowatt came from, because you, you, when you get the votes as the administrator

185
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:21,240
 in the old days, it would have on the bottom what, where the form came from because you

186
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,600
 were still getting PDFs of forms.

187
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,200
 And it became very clear that over half of the votes that were submitted had been distributed

188
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,760
 by Randy Byers.

189
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,000
 And so picking an administrator who works to get the vote out gets you, and if you get

190
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,360
 someone who's good at it, gets you a lot of votes.

191
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,720
 And it's one of those things where I know in British fandom we like to pretend that campaigning

192
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,840
 doesn't help, but campaigning really helps.

193
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,160
 So you've got to, you've got to make sure that you've picked people who will campaign

194
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,800
 and campaign hard.

195
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:57,760
 This is also why when Warren Buff ran in twot housand and - I can't remember when, but a while back

196
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,120
 2012, he picked Paul Cornell, which I remember thinking was a weird choice because I think

197
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,120
 there were some people who were put off by the fact he had picked a pro, but also I

198
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,720
 could not in any way imagine Paul Cornell wandering around in Eastercon nagging people

199
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,720
 to vote.

200
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,800
 It does not seem like a Paul thing to do in any way.

201
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,880
 So yeah, I think there's an art to picking people who are balshy and who will.

202
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,320
 Alison: Yes, I don't think I nagged anyone at the Eastercon to vote.

203
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,440
 John: No, well, if, if I had been, if I had been Sandra, I would have picked someone who was

204
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:31,080
 not working in Eastercon to go with you and, and one of the other two perhaps, but, um.

205
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,480
 Liz: So what, what I find interesting in a way is how swingy the vote totals are in TAFF.

206
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
 John: Oh, yeah.

207
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,600
 Liz: And this was definitely one of our lower, lower numbered ones, but it's interesting

208
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,400
 on how they kind of swing from over 200, kind of under 100.

209
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:49,200
 And I thought at first it might be on the direction of the race.

210
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:57,280
 More people vote in the races that are sending US nominees to the UK or EU than the other

211
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,440
 way, but actually it's not.

212
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,880
 It's just though, obviously there's some people who are really getting out the vote, or maybe

213
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:06,320
 it's related to the number of people who run in the race because you all like mobilise

214
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,280
 the same small set of people.

215
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,800
 But yeah, it is interesting.

216
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,200
 Maybe I will dig into this further for a future episode.

217
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,000
 John: Yeah, I think, I think it is definitely true.

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,800
 I mean, I say definitely.

219
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:23,520
 I strongly suspect that it's true that that if you have active nominators, the vote total

220
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,720
 goes up quite considerably.

221
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,240
 Like when Liam ran against, when Liam and Graham Charnock ran in 2011 against me, like

222
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:39,520
 Liam had like 80 voters just in Europe because he was so on it, but he did not have

223
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,000
 the North American strength to pull it through.

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 Also Liam, if you're listening, we hope you recover fully and quickly.

225
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 Alison: Yeah, no.

226
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,320
 John: I don't think he is listening, but yes, if he is.

227
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
 Alison: Sorry, Liam.

228
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:56,880
 John: And then the EFF, or Efffffff.

229
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,200
 Liz: EFF can be confused with other things.

230
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
 JOhn: Right?

231
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:06,600
 No, but the European Fan Fund was won

232
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,280
 Alison: By Matylda NaczyÅska.

233
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:1 4,440
 John:Congratulations to them and commiserations to James Shields, who ran and didn't really

234
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,520
 want to win, I don't think, but wanted the race to happen and wanted it to be contested.

235
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:26,280
 So yes, but they will visit Konflict, which is in Uppsala in Sweden in June.

236
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,280
 Alison: And we didn't get an awful lot of votes for it.

237
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,360
 So I think, I mean, it's just not surprising given that it was a new fund, but I think

238
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,720
 we'd like to see some more enthusiasm for this for next time, because I do think it's

239
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,720
 a great idea.

240
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:47,240
 It will get some help because it's getting 20% of the Fan Funds funds raised at conversation,

241
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,960
 which, spoiler, is an enormous amount of money.

242
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,040
 So that's quite good.

243
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,000
 John: I think this is a good lesson about how, although hybrid conventions are great, they might not

244
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,280
 be very good at getting Fan Fund votes out.

245
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:03,360
 Because I think if Marcin had been on site at Eastercon, maybe he could have done some more

246
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,640
 wandering around, encouraging people to vote.

247
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,360
 And also if the person at Eastercon was the person in the race who didn't want to win

248
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,520
 as much, maybe he did less campaigning than he might have done.

249
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,960
 So I think what we probably need.

250
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,040
 Alison: And was also quite busy?
 
251
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,000
 John: Yes, and was also quite busy.

252
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,600
 So what you probably want is a British or Irish fan to run who wants to win, and is that

253
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,600
 Eastercon, if your deadline is going to be just after Eastercon, because that will help get

254
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,600
 votes in.

255
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:34,400
 Alison: Yeah, or you could have the sort of British fans who get the vote out for these things,

256
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,280
 not actually also running the Eastercon, also good things.

257
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,680
 So next year I think we'll get more votes out.

258
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,120
 LizHopefully because the contributions from the voting fees, because there are only 33

259
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,440
 voters, the voting fees are about 200 quid when I did all the conversions.

260
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,200
 Because it turns out 353 Polish

261
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,280
 zloty is not a huge amount of money in pounds.

262
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,960
 So I think they will have to try and get the vote out of it, because it's probably not

263
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:06,040
 sustainable to run a fan fund on kind of that plus 20% of a fan fund auction revenue.

264
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:08,720
 Alison: I think there's money basically.

265
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,600
 Marcin's very relaxed about having operating funds for this at the moment.

266
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,960
 And also maybe we'll get TAFF reports or things.

267
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:19,960
 I mean, I've seen quite a lot of Sue's TAFF report, and I'm going to sell a lot more.

268
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,120
 So that means actually, it's going to be a useful amount of money for TAFF.

269
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:34,000
 John: Shall we talk about the Eastercon?

270
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 We've kind of already started talking about Eastercon.

271
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,840
 So that's good.

272
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,600
 But yeah, shall we do that some more?

273
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,600
 Yeah, there was an Eastercon.

274
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,440
 Liz: And are we doing the elephant in the room first or last?

275
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,080
 John: It's the Octothorpe COVID policy round up.

276
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,080
 Yee-haw.

277
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,520
 Alison: A lot of people caught COVID at Eastercon.

278
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,320
 We started counting, but we stopped counting when it was obvious it was going to be enormous

279
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,320
 numbers.

280
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,760
 I mean, it doesn't really matter once you get up above about 80 cases.

281
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,520
 It's like, oh, yes, loads of cases, which it was.

282
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:13,920
 Liz: Yeah, I mean, I did my own personal mini count based on what I could see on Discord,

283
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,720
 Facebook and Twitter, and I got somewhere over 100.

284
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,240
 But yeah, I guess when your question is, doid we give it to 10% of the convention or 15%

285
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,240
 of the convention?

286
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
 OK, you know, maybe that's not a big, a big issue.

287
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,240
 Alison: A lot of people caught COVID at Conversation.

288
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:34,000
 I would prefer that we did not use the phrase "how many people did we give COVID to"?

289
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,920
 We didn't give COVID to anybody.

290
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,880
 A lot of people caught it that weekend.

291
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,440
 John: I'll just leave all of that in.

292
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,960
 And I'm sure that'll be fine.

293
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,440
 Alison: I'm completely fine with that.

294
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,040
 Because, you know, it's a lot of different things.

295
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:50,800
 And people, I hope that we did tell people if you come to a convention where we put 800

296
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,400
 people in a hotel all weekend, there's a good chance you're going to get COVID.

297
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,320
 Because I think we did say that fairly clearly.

298
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,400
 You know, that's why we had a hybrid program where you didn't need to come to the convention

299
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,560
 if you didn't want to catch an illness.

300
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:09,280
 We knew it was going to be quite a high number because last year, by the close of Monday of

301
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,840
 the Eastercon, we'd had five reports.

302
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,840
 And this year, by the 10 o'clock committee meeting on Monday morning, we had had 28

303
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:16,840
 reports.

304
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,600
 So, you know, a lot.

305
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,600
 John: Yes.

306
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,600
 I believe.

307
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,680
 So I caught COVID and Alison caught COVID and Liz did not catch COVID.

308
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,680
 I believe.

309
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,560
 Liz: Did you catch COVID, John?

310
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,560
 John: I got COVID.

311
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:33,600
 I tested positive on Monday last week.

312
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,720
 So I suspect I got it.

313
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,160
 I don't think I got it at the convention.

314
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,600
 I either got it from EspaÃ±a or I got it when I went home to visit my parents.

315
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:45,000
 It would be hilariously bad luck if I avoided it at the Eastercon and got it on a train to

316
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,160
 Peterborough while fully masked, but there you are.

317
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
 But it's very mild.

318
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,280
 If I hadn't tested, if EspaÃ±a hadn't had it, I would not have tested.

319
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:57,120
 I had a very vaguely sore throat.

320
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:03,600
 But yes, EspaÃ±a got it with the unfortunate, there's an unfortunate side effect, which

321
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:09,280
 is that EspaÃ±a has decided, I think, that future Eastercons without mask mandates will

322
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,800
 not be a thing she comes to.

323
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,000
 So that might mean I am not at them either, which makes me slightly sad.

324
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:23,520
 I was hoping that despite being quite convinced this would end up being a rather large incidence

325
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,600
 of COVID, I was hoping I was wrong.

326
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,640
 And I am very sad I was not wrong.

327
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,320
 And yeah, I haven't quite processed that yet because I've been to every Eastercon since

328
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,880
 2007 and it will be weird to break that streak.

329
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,120
 But that's that.

330
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,480
 That's how the cookie crumbles.

331
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,880
 My wife's thresholds are clearly in a different place from the community's.

332
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:52,520
 And that's just something I have to sort of process in my own time.

333
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,480
 Alison: I think there's a wide range of views in the community because there's definitely people

334
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,960
 who are there with you.

335
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,800
 The problem is we'd have had a lot of COVID at that convention, even if we'd had a full

336
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
 mask mandate.

337
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,000
 We wouldn't have had as much, definitely.

338
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,880
 But we wouldn't have mandated masking in the hotel bar or in the breakfast room of the

339
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,880
 hotel.

340
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,600
 We couldn't have done or in the Hilton's executive lounge or the swimming pool.

341
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,440
 And there was spread in all of those cases that we know about.

342
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:27,680
 John: As I said before, as I said in the episode before the convention, it's all about shifting

343
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,640
 the probability distribution to the left where you can.

344
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
 And there were things the Eastercon could have done to shift it to the left that they chose

345
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:36,440
 not to, which I understand.

346
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,920
 And as I say, my thresholds are in a different place from the communities clearly.

347
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,200
 But that does mean that it has an effect on my future congoing.

348
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,680
 And I'm not going to pretend it doesn't.

349
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:55,680
 You know, I am cognizant of the fact that it's not designed around me and my experience.

350
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:56,840
 And that's right and proper.

351
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,480
 But it does mean in this instance that I am going to be one of the ones that don't come

352
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,920
 to as many in-person conventions.

353
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:07,080
 And that makes me deeply, deeply sad, like really sad.

354
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,040
 But there's nothing I can do about it other than other than argue.

355
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,200
 But I tried that and it doesn't work.

356
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,520
 So now it's time to get used to it, I think.

357
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,480
 Alsisn: Well, I think Farah's planning to tighten up the mask mandate for Levitation.

358
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,800
 But I will have to be at Levitation because I'm doing a big job for Glasgow that will

359
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,320
 mandate my being there.

360
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,600
 But I have no interest in spending my own money to go to events that do have mask mandates.

361
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,400
 So, you know.

362
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,600
 John: No, yeah, I mean, that's it, right?

363
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
 You have won and I have lost.

364
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,040
 But it does feel very much like I have lost.

365
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,480
 Alison: I don't think I have won because I think Levitation is going to tighten up.

366
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,840
 And I think I'll have to go there anyway.

367
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,320
 But if that becomes the way, if Eastercons decide that masking to prevent people from

368
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:55,080
 getting very mild sore throats is the way they're going, then, I mean, obviously, people

369
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,400
 can mask if they like.

370
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,040
 I think that's completely fine.

371
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,880
 I don't  have a problem that says in programme items, you mask.

372
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,080
 But I do have a problem that says in all conventional spaces, you mask.

373
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:10,440
 So, you know, because I like seeing my friends smile and I'm happy to see them smile online,

374
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,560
 which is something I do every day.

375
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,840
 John: I would just say, EspaÃ±a has been mostly unconscious for about a week because it has

376
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,000
 completely exhausted her.

377
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,160
 So it's not just that she got a very mild sore throat.

378
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,160
 And that's the problem.

379
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
 You don't know in advance.

380
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,000
 Alison: I mean, eventually everyone has to have it for the first time, right?

381
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,400
 Because it's a cold, it's going to spread into the system of diseases like all other

382
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
 coronaviruses have.

383
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,240
 Liz: I say, one, we don't know that.

384
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,600
 I don't think we can say this is a bunch of very mild sore throats because, yes, if

385
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:40,680
 it was the only effect of COVID was you've got a very mild sore throat, then yes, I think

386
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,680
 it would be different.

387
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,680
 But we know there's a spectrum of, you know, very mild sore throats through to, you know,

388
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,200
 still serious disease and ongoing serious disease.

389
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,920
 So I don't think it's, I don't think it's very sensible also to say, oh, well, eventually

390
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,840
 it'll be like a coronavirus or like the other coronaviruses because we don't know it will.

391
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,600
 And we also have no idea how long that might take.

392
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,360
 So we'll come back on Octothorpe 3027 to see how that all went.

393
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,760
 I would say personally that while I knew there was a risk of COVID at EasterCon, the

394
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,760
 numbers were shockingly high even to me.

395
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,760
 When you say, you know, there was transmission going, I don't think you can say where transmission

396
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
 happened.

397
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,760
 I mean, yes, obviously the breakfast room on the bar were poorly ventilated and full

398
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,360
 of people close together.

399
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:28,720
 But what I think is like, is there a middle ground we can do which is make it possible

400
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,800
 for people to attend and enjoy the convention without putting themselves at risk while still

401
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:38,400
 allowing people who want to do the risky things to do them?

402
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:43,320
 And I think my attitude is still that, you know, you could draw a line which was make

403
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,720
 it possible for people to go into, basically say masks in program space, mass in the dealer's

404
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,760
 room, mask in the art show, or mass in those spaces and have a mask, a mandatory mask social space.

405
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,960
 And then basically inform people there won't be anything in the bar or the hotel breakfast.

406
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,000
 And then people can make that choice, I think, to know that they'll be able to go to programme

407
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,120
 or if they're dealers to come and deal at the convention and know that people will be wearing

408
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,440
 masks around them and it gives them a level of protection.

409
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,840
 Some people may still say this is not enough and they still wouldn't come.

410
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,200
 Some people will say that's unpleasant, they don't want to sit in programme in masks all day

411
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,200
 and do it.

412
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,120
 But it feels like that's a middle ground between the two extremes.

413
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,040
 We obviously can't please both extremes so maybe I'm going for a middle ground where we

414
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
 try and please someone.

415
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,120
 And maybe that's no good, maybe it's better to go for one or the other.

416
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,760
 But that would be my current feeling about it.

417
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,280
 Alison: I masked as a dealer in the dealer's room last year where you're masking continuously

418
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,800
 for eight hours doing that.

419
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,480
 And I found it extremely unpleasant because you have to talk to people, you have to engage

420
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,120
 with them and that's really quite hard through a mask all day.

421
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,680
 I think I'd definitely be up for, well, we ask people going to the dealer's room and

422
00:24:54,680 --> 00:25:00,400
 art show to mask but I'm not convinced that we should mandate masking for the dealers and

423
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,200
 artists so that's a thing.

424
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:07,640
 It's complicated but we have a lot of convention spaces that weren't dealers room.

425
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:14,360
 John: I feel very strongly, it's been you being unable to work for a week, is 

426
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,680
 more of an inconvenience than someone having to wear a mask for six hours.

427
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:21,440
 I think what I find the most frustrating is the,

428
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,520
 there seems to be an implicit assumption in the discussion that wearing a mask is equally

429
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:30,200
 unpleasant to having COVID and I find that exhausting because I don't think that's true.

430
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,200
 Alison: No, it's not.

431
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,320
 Definitely worse having COVID.

432
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,840
 Even my COVID this time, which was much, much less bad than the other time or possible

433
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
 other two times.

434
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,160
 John: I don't enjoy wearing a mask but I don't enjoy having COVID either.

435
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,240
 And I know which one I prefer.

436
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
 I think there's a,

437
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,840
 I think what a lot of people would like to be able to do is not wear a mask and not get

438
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,760
 COVID and I think those people are clearly very big fans of the fantasy genre.

439
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:55,080
 Because I don't think it works.

440
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,400
 And so I think you have to decide would I rather have COVID or would I rather have the

441
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,240
 inconvenience of wearing a mask and I am surprised by how many people seem to be on the other

442
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,040
 side of that argument to me.

443
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,280
 But again, like, I respect that.

444
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,280
 It just,

445
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,280
 it catches me unawares.

446
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,160
 Alison: Okay, you've got quite a lot of people on your side.

447
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,000
 There's quite a lot of public statements saying, "Oh, we would like this to be quite a lot

448
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 stronger".

449
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,040
 We've had quite a lot of email.

450
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,040
 This is a...

451
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,880
 I know this is a lurkers support me in email thing but when we ask for feedback, which will

452
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,960
 pass to Levitation, quite a lot of the feedback is saying, "We think you struck quite a good

453
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,040
 balance and it's not your fault everyone got COVID."

454
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,120
 I'm not sure I agree with that.

455
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,040
 I think we're far enough after the convention now that I would say that although I wasn't,

456
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,040
 I wasn't involved in the discussion of what our policy should be because dead parents.

457
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:45,680
 But I was happy to go along with the result in order in terms of communicating it and

458
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,240
 letting people know, I think if people had followed our COVID policy, we'd have had less

459
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
 COVID.

460
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:55,480
 But they didn't, which is a thing to say.

461
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,240
 John: No, I want to push back on this, right, because I have heard you said this a few times.

462
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:04,240
 We did tell you in advance what the result of your COVID policy would be on this very

463
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
 podcast.

464
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,520
 Alison: Oh yeah, you were right.

465
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,640
 I want to say this on record on the podcast.

466
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,280
 You were right about that.

467
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,280
 John: Thank you.

468
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,760
 Well, hang on, let me just bask.

469
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,760
 Alison: Sorry, you were right about that.

470
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,480
 You told us it wouldn't work and you were right.

471
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,560
 I also want to say because it's now a month after the convention or something, my personal

472
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:30,800
 view was that we should have had a stronger COVID policy with mandatory masking in programme

473
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:37,360
 spaces and mandatory masking in corridors in convention spaces.

474
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:42,120
 And mandatory masking in the green room, which I think was another place where we know COVID

475
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
 spread quite a lot.

476
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,800
 And we think it's very likely COVID spread quite a lot.

477
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,080
 John: Masking in the green room would have been very difficult.

478
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,720
 Alison: It's hard.

479
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
 Yes.

480
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,800
 Because you would have needed, it was already quite difficult for people on Zoom to hear

481
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,200
 people through the laptops that had been set up on the tables in the green rooms.

482
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,240
 So for those who weren't at the convention, it was hybrid, obviously, and that meant that

483
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,000
 some of the panels had remote participants.

484
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,400
 And so each room, each program room in the hotel had a corresponding table in the green

485
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:18,360
 room, which had the laptop for the virtual green room for that program room on that table.

486
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,640
 And so when you went to green room, you had your table, which was your item, and then

487
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,040
 the laptop had the virtual people.

488
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:29,320
 And I would have to probably think quite carefully about like ambient noise and microphones

489
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,640
 if you wanted that to work, which isn't to say it couldn't work, but. Alison: This is moving

490
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,000
 a little bit away from COVID.

491
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:42,120
 But that was the most experimental part of our hybrid design.

492
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,880
 And we doubled the size of the green room on Saturday afternoon, open brackets after

493
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,080
 the horse had bolted, close brackets.

494
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:53,880
 But we should have had a twice as big a green room in the first place and not doing so was

495
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,720
 a mistake for lots of reasons, including the hybrid elements of green room.

496
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,280
 John: Do you want to say things about COVID before I talk more about green room?

497
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,880
 Because I have more ideas about green room Liz, but they're not really COVID based.

498
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,960
 Liz: Yeah, let's I think when we talk a bit more about hybrid and so on, we should talk about

499
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:10,960
 that.

500
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,600
 I mean, I think my thoughts are covered.

501
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,680
 We're going to keep having this conversation.

502
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:19,040
 I would say that bear in mind that if you collect feedback directly after the convention

503
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:25,360
 when, you know, maybe 120 of your members are quite ill, you may not get the, you know,

504
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,440
 unbiased feedback.

505
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,080
 I think we're going to keep discussing it, but I think we need to also remember that

506
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,680
 masks are not the 100% solution or the only solution and be thinking about other ways

507
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:40,160
 we do things, like the ventilation in the bar was definitely poor.

508
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:43,540
 This was one of those cases where I may have appreciated what some hotels do where they

509
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:48,040
 shove all the con people in a separate breakfast room, because maybe, maybe that would have

510
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:49,040
 been better.

511
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:52,680
 I certainly put a mask on when I go up to get my breakfast from the breakfast buffet.

512
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,000
 And this is partly because I've been trained to in hotels where that is mandatory.

513
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,200
 But also it's quite nice.

514
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,480
 I'm not, you know, spewing spit all over your bacon and eggs.

515
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,120
 You know, it seems like quite a nice thing to do.

516
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,560
 So maybe that should be a thing people do.

517
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,600
 John: And for those who want that service, subscribe to Liz's Onlyfans.

518
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,200
 Liz: But yeah, I think we've got to take all that into account.

519
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,480
 We also got to think about, you know, better ventilation, what we can do maybe as a set

520
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,240
 of Eastercons to  try and encourage that.

521
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:24,320
 I will say one place that I think Conversation couldn't have known this, but it was true

522
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,360
 there was a very big space called the refectory with lots of chairs and tables spread out

523
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,720
 quite a lot where you could take food and drink and socialize.

524
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:35,680
 And it was really underused and then everyone was crammed in the main bar.

525
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:40,800
 So maybe if you did have a fan bar, a bit like Reclamation's, where you had people spread

526
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:45,800
 out and they could get beer there, it might encourage people to just spread out a bit.

527
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,200
 But you know, I think this is a, this is an evolving thing.

528
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,760
 But I think we do need to think about it because I mean, I personally am thinking, okay,

529
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,760
 I had a very nice time.

530
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,200
 I don't regret coming to Eastercon.

531
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,160
 If I had got COVID, it could have been really disastrous.

532
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,920
 I could have been stuck in a hotel for a week.

533
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,760
 I could have had canceled flights.

534
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:07,280
 You know, I could, I'm really, it does make me rethink whether I want to attend future

535
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,920
 Eastercons, unfortunately, because of the risk of disease and because of the risk of

536
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,640
 like, like, disruptive massive disruption to my life.

537
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:19,560
 So I think the numbers basically are, if they stay this high, it will be hard to justify

538
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,680
 it more than occasionally.

539
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,560
 Alison: Yeah, we had the refectory.

540
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:25,280
 We probably could have done a lot more to say to people.

541
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:32,360
 This is a large, airy ventilated space because our program rooms were all very well ventilated

542
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,080
 that you could go and eat food and drink and chat to your friends.

543
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,000
 And it's going to be safer than the bar.

544
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,320
 I mean, I don't know if it was safe for the bar, but I think it probably was.

545
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,640
 And then we also had a mask required lounge, which wasn't used at all.

546
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,040
 John: But no, I don't know whether we talked about that before, but like the other part of the

547
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:52,760
 problem is, I'm going to go to where my friends are.

548
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,120
 I'm not going to sit in the mask required bar and hope my friends come to me.

549
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,560
 So that is tricky.

550
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,760
 I wanted to say, what did I want to say?

551
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:05,280
 This is, it's weird, I think, how much of these discussions are,

552
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,160
 there are things we've been asking for as a convention for ages.

553
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:11,480
 Like when the fan bar and the actual bar are opposite ends of the hotel, like before

554
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,760
 the pandemic, we were like, oh, why aren't they closer together?

555
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,280
 It's such a pain that if someone wants a gin and tonic, they have to be at this end of

556
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,720
 the hotel, but someone wants real ale they have to be there in the hotel.

557
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,480
 Why can't they be in the same place.

558
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,920
 And then we finally cracked that issue and like, why can't we have breakfast with all

559
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:27,160
 of the normal people with the nice breakfast place instead of being in a little ghetto?

560
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:30,720
 We've cracked that issue and now the pandemic's happened to be like, why can't, why can't

561
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,760
 we be in our little ghetto and why can't the real ale be the other side of the hotel?

562
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,320
 It's so unfair.

563
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:40,840
 And so that just occurs to me, it's like, you know, it's like the, someone's clearly

564
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,240
 made a wish on a monkey paw for these things that has gone badly.

565
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,760
 So if that was you, write in.

566
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,680
 Alison: Before we go off COVID, we're about to go off COVID, right?

567
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,440
 So we haven't said the keyword.

568
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,240
 I would not like to be the Levitation chair right now.

569
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,240
 Hello, Farah.

570
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,880
 John: No, it'll be a tricky job.

571
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:03,480
 Alison: Because you've got a lot of work collecting all these different points of view together

572
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,800
 and ending up with something that works.

573
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
 John: You should do a survey.

574
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,040
 You should do a survey.

575
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,120
 To a survey, have Likert scales.

576
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,480
 I love a good survey.

577
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,480
 Alison: Yeah, Levitation.

578
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,480
 Do a survey.

579
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,000
 Ask your members what they actually think and do it in a way that means that it won't,

580
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,920
 their personal views will not be made public or get back to people who can harangue them

581
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,320
 a lot on the internet because there's some very harangue-y people on both sides of the

582
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,320
 document.

583
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,400
 Liz: I think it may be time for a survey.

584
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,600
 I'm just going to say I don't think it should just be Levitation members because obviously

585
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,520
 there will be people who aren't joining Levitation for that reason.

586
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,160
 But you probably don't want it to be completely open.

587
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:44,200
 But we have surveyed Eastercon members before in the Future of Eastercon surveys.

588
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,240
 It might be time to do something like that.

589
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,320
 You're not going to guarantee it will change your positions, but it would be interesting

590
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,120
 to know how many people fall into which different set of opinions.

591
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,240
 Alison: I do love that we have people on both sides of this argument in this podcast.

592
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,800
 I think it would be very sad if I never saw John as a convention again, but you know,

593
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,000
 I'd cope.

594
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,600
 Liz: Would you wear a mask if it meant you would see John as a convention?

595
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,680
 Alison: I see John at times other than conventions.

596
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,360
 John: But I am just going to say the other thing that would change a lot of this is if you could

597
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:17,640
 get a COVID booster from Boots and you could get it in late February because my attitude

598
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,080
 towards a lot of this would change drastically if I could reliably get a booster three weeks

599
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,200
 before the convention.

600
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,240
 Alison: I do very unsafe things at Novacon every year and I have not caught COVID at Novicon and

601
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:31,160
 that's because I always have my booster in October.

602
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,880
 Novacon's a month later.

603
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,880
 It's fine.

604
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,800
 I would like to have a second booster a month before Eastercon and not only would

605
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
 I get one but I woule tell lots of people.

606
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,760
 I'd probably be sicker with the booster than I was with COVID this time, but at least I

607
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,400
 wouldn't worry that I was infecting all my friends.

608
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,320
 John: Well you can plan it then, it's quite nice because we had to, Mike Wozniak gig and

609
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,800
 I was like, we'll be able to go to that because if we do get COVID, we'll have recovered by

610
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
 the time that happens.

611
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,720
 But then I ended up testing seven days after the convention positive and then I had skipped

612
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,720
 the gig.

613
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,520
 That was incredibly irritating.

614
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
 So boo.

615
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
 I've got to be honest.

616
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,440
 That's the other thing, right?

617
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,080
 Like if next year there is a Mike Wozniak gig within a week of Eastercon.

618
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:15,160
 I might like Mike Wozniak's moustache more than I like Eastercon.

619
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,280
 You can quote me on that.

620
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,280
 Alison: It was spectacularly inconvenient for me catching COVID at Eastercon.

621
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,880
 Marianne also caught COVID and had to delay the start date of her job.

622
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,600
 So, you know, that is a pain in the ass.

623
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,920
 Liz: It's a very brief plug.

624
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,560
 So, I mean, I have no way of actually properly assessing this or not.

625
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:36,840
 But I bought a nasal spray with like one of these things that like, just put stuff in

626
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,000
 your nasal mucus and puts, you know, antibodies up there or whatever.

627
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,240
 Like one of those Boots, like the, you know, Boots Dual Defence things, it's like that.

628
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,200
 It's also got anti-COVID antibodies in there.

629
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,880
 And I don't know if it made a difference or not, but it was not, like, horrible to do.

630
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,120
 And it was 15 quid and I put it up my nostrils twice a day and I was definitely sitting around

631
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,280
 chatting with people who got COVID and I did not get COVID.

632
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,320
 So I think that will be part of my regimen for future events, to be honest.

633
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,400
 Alison: Oh, I'm 100% up for that.

634
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,400
 John: Sounds good.

635
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,400
 Liz: Can't buy it.

636
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,400
 It's Thailand only.

637
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,400
 I'll bring you a bottle next time.

638
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,160
 John: I want to talk very quickly about the green room.

639
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:18,840
 This is one area where I think the way that Conversation did green room made me think

640
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:24,160
 that you could have done with a lot of tiny rooms like they have at the Park Inn 

641
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,240
 in Heathrow because then you could have a tiny, you could have a green room per room?

642
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,360
 And that would be quite good for stopping spread.

643
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,560
 I don't know.

644
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,280
 And the problem is with conference centres.

645
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,280
 So I don't know whether this will work for Levitation or for Reconnect, which is the 2025

646
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:44,080
 Belfast Eastercon because they're both convention center Eastercons.

647
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:50,040
 But like if you did have a lot of rooms that were too small to be useful, having different

648
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:54,800
 green rooms in them, if you were going to use the same model as Conversation might potentially

649
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,040
 be a good way of doing things.

650
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,360
 I mean, it might also not be, but it was just a thought I had.

651
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,920
 It's a bit of a pain for the green room stuff because to tell if people are actually

652
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,720
 there, you can't check them in.

653
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,160
 You need that entry gate really.

654
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,160
 Yeah.

655
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,120
 Alison: I think we should have a hundred percent virtual green room.

656
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,480
 I think the green room is an enormous faff and that people should just join in or log in

657
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,800
 on a zoom and have a chat.

658
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,240
 John: I cannot successfully overstate how much I disagree with that.

659
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,800
 No, so okay.

660
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,880
 So I think the green room, I think there are three reasons I disagree.

661
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,240
 I will now enumerate them.

662
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,040
 Reason one, logging onto a Zoom.

663
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:40,720
 I didn't log on to the Zoom during the convention and that adds a layer of things I have to

664
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,720
 worry about.

665
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:45,440
 But I'm glad I didn't have to worry about and I was glad that I could if I needed to,

666
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,920
 but I was equally glad I didn't have to.

667
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,160
 Second thing is I really like, I really like having like my drink sorted before going to

668
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,160
 the panel rather than having it delivered to the room the panel is happening in.

669
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,280
 So that I think would suffer a little bit.

670
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:06,280
 But thirdly, I quite like getting the vibe of my fellow panelists off stage before being

671
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,040
 on the panel with them, especially if it's someone I don't know very well.

672
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,120
 I kind of like being able to feel them out a bit.

673
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:15,600
 I wouldn't have liked, especially, I'm going to plug the Adrian Tchaikovsky interview

674
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:20,120
 again sorry listeners, but especially when I met Adrian Tchaikovsky for the first time,

675
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:24,120
 I'm glad that that like initial feeling each other out about the interview didn't happen

676
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,520
 virtually because I think doing it in person was probably a better way to get ready for

677
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,520
 the panel.

678
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,040
 So those are some unformed thoughts about that.

679
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,120
 But it's definitely an idea.

680
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,200
 I hope that wasn't too strident.

681
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,280
 Alison: So yeah, I think the green room was very experimental.

682
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,440
 I hope we do more hybrid.

683
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:44,240
 I think hybrid was a huge success for this gcon.

684
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
 John: Yep.

685
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:50,800
 Alison: I love the way that on the Friday morning everyone was like, oh, this item has a disembodied

686
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,320
 face coming in, that's weird, and by Monday everyone was like, oh, no, we've got a couple

687
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,440
 of virtual things that it was just part of what happened at the Eastercon and I think

688
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,920
 that's quite good.

689
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,880
 So props to JT, who has worked incredibly hard for 18 months, making this happen.

690
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,320
 John: I tell you what, JT's sad nod in the Octothorpe Live episode.

691
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,920
 I really wish there'd been a camera on JT because that was one of the funniest.

692
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,520
 Alison: I didn't see his sad nod, so you'll have to describe it to me.

693
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,280
 You said on your big screen of doom, like I think JT's the tech lead for Glasgow if

694
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,880
 he is can he wave, or maybe I said if you can you wave, and he just did the saddest nod

695
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,040
 in the entire world and it was incredibly funny.

696
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:38,240
 He always has at least one hilarious interjection in Octothorpe Live episodes at Eastercon.

697
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
 So that's good.

698
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
 It's a good tradition.

699
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,240
 Yeah.

700
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,720
 Liz: So I mean, are we talking virtual?

701
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,720
 John: We can do.

702
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,720
 This is a thing.

703
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,840
 Liz: The convention did virtual really, really well.

704
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:52,040
 I know there were a few teething problems and maybe people who turned up to their virtual

705
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,560
 green rooms a bit late *cough* Alison.

706
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,480
 Alison Oh, I had a massive, massive problem getting on.

707
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,000
 Liz: So that was an unforeseen situation where he had to suddenly add in a Zoom stream that

708
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,440
 was not previously planned.

709
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,800
 But basically, it seemed to go really, really well.

710
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,360
 Now I think now we know it can be done that well.

711
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:17,740
 I would feel much more confident about trying to do an Eastercon purely virtually because

712
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,400
 honestly, I thought it would be either like some streams I could watch, but they would

713
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,280
 occasionally crash or they wouldn't quite work on Friday afternoon or, you know, they

714
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,520
 wouldn't be seen and everything would be delayed.

715
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,560
 Like now I know it can be done and they look great and the panelists managed to join.

716
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,040
 There's no problems with missing panelists and things.

717
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,480
 I would be much more likely to do future Eastercons virtually because I know it may work.

718
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:44,920
 And so I don't know if Conversation just, I don't know whether you just didn't promote

719
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:48,440
 it in places I could see it or whether you were still a little bit wary of promoting it

720
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:49,440
 too heavily.

721
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,040
 But I saw a lot of, oh, there will be lots of hybrid stuff.

722
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:55,880
 But if it was like, you will be able to see everything except maybe the Lego room and

723
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,640
 it will all be streaming and it will be live and you can ask questions in Discord and it

724
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,760
 will be brilliant then might have got like slightly more people joining virtually.

725
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,920
 Alison: I mean, I think that was always our vision, right?

726
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,240
 You don't want to say we're going to do this thing that nobody else has come anywhere close

727
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,040
 to too hard in case it's a disaster.

728
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,080
 I'm incredibly proud of what we achieved.

729
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,240
 You guys were both at the convention in person all of the time.

730
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:29,160
 So you won't know that the Discord was also absolutely exactly what I hoped a convention

731
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:36,600
 Discord would be and Andrew and Emily January take a huge amount of credit for making that

732
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,600
 happen.

733
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,080
 And of course, the Discord started early.

734
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,680
 We got over half the convention onto the Discord before the convention started, which is part

735
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:45,840
 of our vision.

736
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:49,760
 And then it carried on until the end of the catch up.

737
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,680
 I don't know whether that will have happened or not by the time this episode drops for

738
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,800
 reasons, but it might have happened.

739
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,400
 So it actually does that thing and I'm going to claim some visionary bit for this,

740
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:05,600
 my vision that the Discord should surround and envelope the cons so that you have that

741
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,040
 sense of being part of it before it starts, especially if you're new, and you have that

742
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:12,600
 sense of it supporting the catch-up for the convention.

743
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:13,800
 But it was also good.

744
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,520
 People who came to the convention virtually felt that they were engaged socially with

745
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,440
 the convention as well as by watching the streaming, which was another part of what

746
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,400
 I very much hoped would happen.

747
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:31,400
 John: I do just want to say that even though I was at the convention in meatspace, I did be on

748
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,640
 the Discord.

749
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:39,560
 I think any even purely meatspace conventions should have good Discords because even if

750
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:45,640
 you're not attending at all hybridly or virtually, I think having a strong Discord is just such

751
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:46,640
 a boon.

752
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:51,760
 Alison: I would agree with that, but there is an issue for large conventions, which is that we manually

753
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,960
 gate them.

754
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,480
 We believe it's possible to run an automatic gate into Discord because obviously Patreons

755
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,160
 and so on do it.

756
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,480
 And James Shields is having a think about that at Andrew January, but unless we can

757
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:09,040
 get an automatic gate, we can't manage this for say the Worldcon.

758
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,600
 We'll need to use another less good solution.

759
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,920
 I mean, I think we can have an automatic gate.

760
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:17,400
 John: James and Andrew, if you're listening, I'd be interested in being in that working group

761
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,680
 trying to do that automatically.

762
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:28,040
 Alison: I am concerned that Worldcon is considering single sign-on solutions and certainly as

763
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,080
 at the last time I looked at them, they were all still appalling.

764
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:38,920
 Chicon's use of Airmeet was dreadful and I think we need to do better and Discord is

765
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,120
 the obvious way to do it.

766
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:46,640
 And I feel like, you know, obviously this may be all sorted by next year.

767
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,840
 All threads for programme items are amazingly good.

768
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,160
 They are the best thing, even if it's not Octothorpe and you have 310 people posting

769
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,120
 memes and taking the piss.

770
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,040
 But I mean, you know, serious Discord threads are also great.

771
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,920
 John: Even if you can't do automatic onboarding, which thing you can, the other thing you could

772
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:11,640
 do is manually add people to a read-only Discord like a year and a half out because that is

773
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,160
 also possible.

774
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,440
 It's less elegant, but it is possible.

775
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,040
 Alison: Yes, but then you have to moderate your Discord for a year and a half.

776
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,800
 John: No, no, read-only.

777
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:25,000
 You can give everyone a role that lets them see one channel they can't post in and that

778
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,880
 is entirely possible.

779
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,880
 It would be less good though.

780
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,880
 Alison: Okay, yep.

781
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,640
 Glasgow, if you're listening to this, I am happy to manually gate everybody into your

782
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,240
 Discord a year and a half out along the lines that John suggests.

783
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:46,600
 Liz: I mean, can you choose a better time period to do it because if you do it year and a half

784
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,320
 out, a bunch of people are going to change their email addresses, forget the Discord

785
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,720
 logins, you know. Before the con, but not like now.

786
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,560
 John: It would be much better to have an automatic solution.

787
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:03,560
 Liz: It did seem to me that the kind of Discord plus Zoom plus whatever magic JT was doing

788
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:08,240
 to stream to hidden YouTube streams was the best way of doing it.

789
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,160
 I mean, I guess it had the problem that you could in theory send people the links to

790
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,160
 the YouTube streams because they weren't actually gated.

791
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,840
 But it did seem to work better than Airmeet.

792
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,240
 I mean, the main issue with it was just actually getting people logged on because I don't

793
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,240
 think James Shields' registration system is actually designed for that.

794
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,520
 Alison: Yeah, there was a bug in the registration.

795
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:32,640
 What we should have done with the great evidence of hindsight is if we'd had a couple of

796
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,680
 streaming items a couple of weeks before the convention, the same way that we opened the

797
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:37,680
 Discord.

798
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,600
 If we said also check that your streaming system works by logging on as streaming this test

799
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:47,360
 item, we'd have got a lot of people in through that and we would have, it probably wouldn't

800
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,080
 be all of them, but we'd have identified the bug in the registration system that meant

801
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,840
 that we ended up with a 10-step process in time that we could sort it out because by

802
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:59,420
 the time we did realize we had a problem, the convention had started and we couldn't

803
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:02,200
 possibly have implemented a fix.

804
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,760
 Liz: Are you suggesting some kind of testing of software is a good thing?

805
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:12,640
 Alison: The other thing I wanted to say on virtual is that the one area that we fell down was

806
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:20,240
 face-to-face socials like Zoom socials because we were hoping that that would happen through

807
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:24,160
 the Discord AV tables and it just didn't.

808
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,640
 And I would like, that's something that I think you do need to put a volunteer into

809
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:36,080
 early to make happen and people designing future hybrid conventions need to put a bit

810
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:42,280
 more energy into that particular element of things which slightly surprised me.

811
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,680
 I thought that once we had virtual things and encouraged people to use them, that would

812
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:47,720
 be enough, but it wasn't.

813
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,480
 Liz: What were you hoping that people would just sort of sit at a virtual table in the hope

814
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,080
 that someone else might come along to chat to them at the virtual table?

815
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,800
 Alison: I thought that a few people would.

816
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:57,280
 That has worked at some cons.

817
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,200
 Liz: But I don't think you had enough purely, if you weren't a virtual member, then you were

818
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:06,600
 probably in the refectory or the bar or maybe somewhere slightly better ventilation.

819
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:09,120
 I don't think you had enough people in the right time zone to make that work because

820
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,040
 remember a lot of your hybrid attendees, if I was hybrid, I'm not turning up to the bar

821
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:16,360
 at the bar times because I'm asleep.

822
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:22,760
 So I just think, yeah, I don't know, it seems incredibly optimistic to think that this will

823
00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:28,120
 self-organise itself. I think just a kind of like, "This is our morning Zoom social,

824
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:31,160
 this is our evening Zoom social", would have probably worked.

825
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:37,000
 Alison: Yeah, I mean, we had a couple of Cafe Mooses and they went quite well as hybrids.

826
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,000
 So yeah.

827
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,200
 Liz: Yeah, but Mooses already got people, basically people who know how Zoom socials work and

828
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:47,200
 kind of, you know, I mean, I guess maybe most people do by now, but yeah, I still think

829
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,640
 you need a bit of like, hand-holding to make sure everyone gets there and figures it out

830
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:53,960
 and has a nice socially time.

831
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:59,400
 Alison: No, because obviously Zoom socials at hybrids are very important to me, but if I'm attending

832
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,240
 a convention virtually, I just make sure they happen even if they're not on the programme

833
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,440
 and not part of the plan. But obviously, if I'm attending a convention in person, I'm

834
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:11,720
 not going to spend hours on Zoom unless I find myself stuck in my hotel room. But I

835
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:15,680
 wasn't actually stuck in my hotel room with COVID for very long and I was quite busy, so

836
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,800
 Liz: I did think, I mean, I've been to that hotel before, I've never actually stayed in

837
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,560
 that hotel. I treated myself to an actual room in the hotel, which was nice, except

838
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:29,360
 for the weird, my personal rant, why do the hotel rooms not have any drawers in? Who decided

839
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,560
 to get weird nightstands with tripod legs?

840
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:38,960
 John: This hotel room I'm currently in also does not. It is in fashion, Liz, drawers for idiots,

841
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:44,040
 shelves and hangers are in vogue. And whoever decided that, oof.

842
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:52,200
 Alison: I mean, our room, which was a suite in the Hilton, did not have, it's not that it didn't

843
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,520
 have drawers, because I think not having drawers is a great idea. The problem with drawers is

844
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,440
 that people leave their stuff in them. But if you have shelves that fulfil the function

845
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:05,320
 of drawers, that's still a lot better than not having them. But their view seemed to be that

846
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:09,560
 your entire storage would be the rack that you put your suitcase on. And because our

847
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:15,920
 car was so full, our suitcases were actually just packing cubes. So we didn't have anything.

848
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,200
 If we'd had shelves that would have been something.

849
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,920
 Liz: I would accept shelves. I mean...

850
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:26,840
 John: This room has two shelves and room for about hanging 20 pieces of clothes, which is, I

851
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:30,560
 mean I can hang all my t-shirts up, but I gotta be honest, usually I keep them in a

852
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:36,240
 folded pile, and I imagine I am not atypical. Or I am atypical in many ways, but not in

853
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,640
 this particular one. Alison: I can't imagine circumstances in which I hang up a t-shirt really.

854
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:45,560
 Liz: When there's no drawers or shelves, that's when you hang a t-shirt. Alison: No, I just leave

855
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:50,840
 them at an orderly pile on the floor, Liz. Liz: Oh yeah, I don't put my clothes on the floor.

856
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:55,600
 John: Oh no, I mean I've got standards. Liz: Yeah. I mean I also bought a lot of clothes when

857
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:59,880
 I was there, so I did really want somewhere to kind of sort them and stash them until

858
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:07,280
 I took them home. But otherwise, I think that is a nice hotel. I think it is one of my favourite

859
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:12,200
 of the Eastercon hotels we've been to recently, just because it's big. I never had to queue

860
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,320
 for programme rooms. There was just tons of space in nearly all of them. The corridor

861
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:22,600
 is big. It's not as maze-like as some of the others. You can have a nice big dealer's room.

862
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:28,200
 It's not too difficult to get to. It's in walking distance of a mainline train station.

863
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:33,360
 Initially, you have to walk through the NEC, which may be full of 40,000 people who all

864
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,720
 want to play Call of Duty. But...

865
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,600
 John: On the way back to the train station, on the last night I had to walk through the NEC

866
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:43,680
 and they wanted to check my bag. I was like, "What happens if you don't like my bag?"

867
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,640
 I'm not walking round. I'm going through to the train station. And I got very grumpy.

868
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:54,000
 So yeah, I don't like having to have a random man check in my bag so I can walk to a train

869
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:57,520
 station without having to go round the way that takes three times as long. But that is

870
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:03,760
 a minor complaint in general, but I mean it was very well connected and I quite like it

871
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,840
 as a venue for the Eastercon in general.

872
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:10,200
 Alison: Anything else people want to say? We should probably say the programme was amazing. Well

873
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,200
 done, Z.

874
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,320
 John: Oh yes, no. The programme was really good. The catch-up was really good. The hybrid was

875
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:21,400
 really good. The real ale I quite liked. The porter was good.

876
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,920
 Alison: I liked the real ale. It wasn't as good as it could have been, but it was pretty bloody

877
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:30,240
 good and it was a lot better than last time or the time before that when we'd been in

878
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,200
 that hotel. So yay.

879
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:38,480
 Liz: However, seven quids, seven pounds for a pint. My brain cannot process this.

880
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:43,920
 Alison: Yep, so that was a lot, but my theory was that people would grumble but they would pay

881
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,760
 it and that seems to be correct. Caroline was very worried that we wouldn't meet our food

882
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:50,400
 and beverage and...

883
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,840
 And John Dodd was like, "Oh Caroline, you do not need to worry. We passed it off Friday

884
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:59,040
 evening." Liz: I mean, I think a lot of people ate in the hotel as well.

885
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:03,720
 John: Oh, the food trucks. Liz: The food trucks were great. John:Did the food trucks count towards your

886
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,480
 food and drink spend? Alison: Yes.

887
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:07,040
 Liz: Ah, okay.

888
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,400
 John: Ha ha. The life hack. That is very clever.

889
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,720
 Alison: Food trucks on the real ale and all of the hotels bar stuff. So all the... I'm pretty

890
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,960
 sure that all of what was it called insomnia people who were staying in the hotel and who

891
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,200
 were drinking and eating in the Hilton bar in the evenings, of whom they were quite

892
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:28,360
 a lot all-couted to our food and beverage spend. Because there was no way to differentiate

893
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:31,000
 that from a convention spend, right?

894
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,560
 John: No. No, yeah, no, it's fair enough.

895
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:39,200
 Liz: I think I drank fewer pints because they were seven quid and also they were nice. I didn't

896
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:44,360
 think the convention specific beer was very nice, but the other ones were nice. But I

897
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,160
 don't know if I'm out of touch or what, but seven pounds.

898
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:51,600
 John: That was the Octothorpe podcast and it's goodbye from me.

899
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,160
 Alison: It's goodbye from me. Liz: It's goodbye from me.

900
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:20,000
 Alison: So I don't know if this is something that you guys will appreciate, but Caroline Mullan

901
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:24,320
 has just messaged me to say, "Alison, are you all right? You haven't posted anywhere

902
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,280
 on anything since this morning."

903
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,880
 John: Have we been podcasting so long that people are worried about you?

904
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,280
 Liz: Yes. We've been podcasting for three hours.

905
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:40,400
 John: This is a savage indictment of how permanently online you are and also how long we have been

906
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,400
 doing this.

907
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,960
 Alison: We have been doing it a long time.

908
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:43,960
 John: Yeah.
